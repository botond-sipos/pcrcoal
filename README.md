pcrcoal
=======

<tt>pcrcoal</tt> is an <tt>R</tt> package implementing the coalescent approach to PCR simulation developed by Weiss and von Haeseler ([NAR, 1997](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/25.15.3082)). The package reports the simulated genealogies as <tt>phylo</tt> objects compatible with the [ape](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape) package. The reported branch lengths have one replication as unit.

See the package [reference manual](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcrcoal/pcrcoal.pdf) for more information.

<tt>pcrcoal</tt> was brought to you by the [Goldman group](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman) from [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk).
